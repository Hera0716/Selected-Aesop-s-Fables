	<p>Welcome to The Peatcutter’s Croft, a 150-year-old croft house on the hill above Little
	Loch Broom. Set in 11 acres of working croft land, it nestles on the foothills of Beinn
	Goblach and has uninterrupted views across to the imposing peaks of An Teallach and
	down to the shimmering loch below.</p>

	<p>Our stylish bed and breakfast apartment is the perfect get-away-from-it-all destination
	all year round. Only an hour’s drive from Inverness, but situated at the end of an 8-
	mile single-track road, it’s the perfect retreat for lovers, adventurers or families
	looking for a contemporary slice of Scottish life.</p>

	<p>Our tastefully-furnished apartment has its own front door so you can come and go as
	you please, making it the perfect base for taking it easy or enjoying the rich outdoor
	pursuits the area is so famous for. We can also cook a delicious meal of locallysourced and homegrown produce for you to come home to.</p>

	<p>Just a short stroll across the fields is the house's own rocky beach where you can sit in
	perfect solitude on the rocks and watch for porpoises or fish for fresh mackerel to grill
	on the Rayburn. The more adventurous can scale one of the area’s 22 Munros or cycle
	along the footpath to the pioneering Scoraig community at the tip of the peninsula.
	When the day’s over you can luxuriate in front of the apartment’s toasty peat fire.	</p>

	<p>Come to enjoy the good life at Peatcutter’s Croft and discover the beauty of
	Badrallach.</p>
