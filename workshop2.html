	<h1>Selected Aesop's Fables</h1>

	<h2>The Wolf and the Crane</h2>

	<p class="first"><span class="word">A</span> WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. 
	When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed:</p>
	<blockquote><p>"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from 
	the mouth and jaws of a wolf."</p></blockquote>
	<p><em>In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.</em></p>

	<h2>Hercules and the Wagoner</h2>
	<p class="second"><span class="word">A</span> CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, 
	stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and 
	thus addressed him: </p>
	<blockquote><p>"Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me for help, until you have 
	done your best to help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain."</p></blockquote>
	<p><em>Self-help is the best help.</em></p>

	<h2>The Hare and the Tortoise</h2>
	<p class="second"><span class="word">A</span> HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who replied, laughing:</p>
	<blockquote><p>"Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race."</p></blockquote> 
	<p class="second">The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose 
	the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, 
	but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. 
	At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>
	<p><em>Slow but steady wins the race.</em></p>

	<h2>The Farmer and the Snake</h2>
	<p class="second"><span class="word">O</span> NE winter a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. 
	The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. </p>
	<blockquote><p>"Oh," cried the Farmer with his last breath, "I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel."</p></blockquote>
	<p><em>The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.</em></p>


	<h2>The Fawn and His Mother</h2>
	<p class="second"><span class="word">A</span> YOUNG fawn once said to his Mother, </p>
	<blockquote><p>"You are larger than a dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother!
	Do the hounds frighten you so?"</p></blockquote>
	<p class="second">She smiled, and said: </p>
	<blockquote><p>"I know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a 
	single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can."</p></blockquote>
	<p><em>No arguments will give courage to the coward.</em></p>


	<h2>The Flies and the Honey-Pot</h2>
	<p class="second"><span class="word">A</span> NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in it, 
	ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, and were 
	suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed,</p> 
	<blockquote><p>"O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves."</p></blockquote>
	<p><em>Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.</em></p>
